            Modeling and designing the emotion detection method for agents in
            the crowd by measuring the behavioral changes in the crowd in
            real-time. Making a Crowd Simulator and designing behavioral agents
            in a crowd that responds to different situations such as normal,
            busy and emergency scenarios. Crowd simulator is made in agile so it
            is easy to change for any kind of scenario and layout to simulate
            the crowd. Crowd emotion detection is based on probabilistic
            graphical model-based machine learning so the machine learning
            method can be used anywhere for logical reasoning and automatic
            responses. Right now, I am working on a panic behavior simulation
            design in agents to simulate an emergency scenario to understand how
            the crowd behaves in panic.

            Estimation of emotions is an essential aspect of developing
            intelligent systems intended for crowded environments. However,
            emotion estimation in crowds remains a challenging problem due to
            the complexity in which human emotions are manifested and the
            capability of a system to perceive them in such conditions. This
            paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian model to learn in an
            unsupervised manner the behavior of individuals and the crowd as a
            single entity and explore the relation between behavior and emotions
            to infer emotional states. Information about the movement patterns
            of individuals are described using a self-organizing map, and a
            hierarchical Bayesian network builds probabilistic models to
            identify behaviors and infer the emotional state of individuals and
            the crowd. This model is trained and tested using data produced from
            simulated scenarios that resemble real-life environments. The
            conducted experiments tested the efficiency of our method to learn,
            detect and associate behaviors with emotional states yielding
            accuracy levels of 74% for individuals and 81% for the crowd,
            similar in performance with existing methods for pedestrian behavior
            detection but with novel concepts regarding the analysis of crowds.

            Perceiving crowd emotions and understand the situation is vital to
            control the situations in surveillance applications. This paper
            introduces the evolution of methods for crowd emotion perception
            based on bio-inspired probabilistic models. The emotions have been
            perceived both in an offline and online manner from the crowd. We
            focus on the perception of emotion from crowd behavior and dynamics.
            The paper explains few probabilistic algorithms and compares these
            for detection of the emotion of crowds and proposes a probabilistic
            modeling approach that is trained on data to perceive the emotions
            of the crowd in an area under surveillance. Emotions are defined as
            evolving dynamic patterns arising due to the interaction of people
            in an environment with their relationships to the past interaction
            patterns. Camera sensors are used to track the motion of the
            individuals within a crowd scenario under observation. The data
            mining techniques are used to distinguish between different
            behaviors and events into positive and negative emotions. The
            results have been evaluated using simulated data from a proposed
            office environment.
